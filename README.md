# Phyrox-Default-Browser

Simple .VBS script that will make Phyrox the default browser. Modfified version of the original "FirefoxPortable.vbs" created by Ramesh Srinivasan for Winhelponline.com. All the credits (and thanks to him).

I only modified the names to match the Phyrox executable name. If you want to have Firefox logo instead of Phyrox one, you need to modify this line on the .vbs:

sIconPath = sAppPath & "\phyrox-portable.exe"

For this one:

sIconPath = sAppPath & "\app\firefox.exe"
